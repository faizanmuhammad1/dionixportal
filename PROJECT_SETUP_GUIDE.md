# 🏗️ Project Management System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the complete project management system with Supabase integration, file uploads, and comprehensive project tracking.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Next.js 14+ project
- Supabase account and project
- Node.js 18+ installed

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. Database Schema Setup

Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the required tables:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of lib/database-schema.sql
-- This includes:
-- - projects table with all required fields
-- - project_activities table for audit trail
-- - RLS policies for security
-- - Triggers for automatic updates
-- - Indexes for performance
```

### 2. Supabase Storage Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage
3. Create a new bucket named `project-media`
4. Set the bucket to public if you want public file access
5. Configure RLS policies for the bucket:

```sql
-- Allow users to upload files to their project folders
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload to their project folders"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to view files in their project folders
CREATE POLICY "Users can view files in their project folders"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to delete files from their project folders
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete files from their project folders"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

The following dependencies are already included in your package.json:

```json
{
  "@supabase/ssr": "latest",
  "@supabase/supabase-js": "latest",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.60.0",
  "@hookform/resolvers": "^3.10.0",
  "zod": "3.25.67",
  "date-fns": "4.1.0"
}
```
